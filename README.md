<h4 align="center">If you have any changes or improvements you'd like to contribute for review and merge, to update conventional mistakes or for QoL, as well as maybe even adding whole new features, you can follow the general outline below to get a local copy of the source building.</h4>

</br>

1. Install/Update ``Xcode``
    - Visit https://xcodereleases.com/ for your appropriate latest version.

2. Prepare source code
    - ``git clone --recursive https://github.com/Carnations-Botanica/iBridged.git``
    - Get the latest ``DEBUG`` Lilu.kext from [Releases](https://github.com/acidanthera/Lilu/releases) and update your EFI with it. Example Repository contents below.
        - iBridged/iBridged.xcodeproj <- Xcode Project file.
        - iBridged/iBridged/ <- Project Contents.
        - iBridged/MacKernelSDK <- Gotten by using ``--recursive``.
        - iBridged/Lilu <- Gotten by using ``--recursive``.
        - iBridged/README.md <- How you can tell you're in the root.

3. Launch ``.xcodeproj`` with Xcode to begin!
    - ``kern_start.cpp`` - Contains main Orchestrator for initializing various modules of reroutes.
    - ``kern_start.hpp`` - Header for Main, sets up various macros and globals and the IBGD class.
    - ``kern_ioreg.cpp`` - Injects the `apple-coprocessor-version` property for various update related services
    - ``kern_ioreg.hpp`` - Header for IOR module.
    - ``kern_dyld.cpp`` - Patches the full installer's frameworks and the system copies.
    - ``kern_dyld.hpp`` - Header for the DYLD module.
